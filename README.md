# Todo Web app

This is a todo website that renders schedules on a slideable timetable, similar to google calendar     

## Get started

Ensure you have >= python 3.6.4 installed

Install the dependencies...

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
# In cmd.exe
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# In PowerShell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

...then startup the server 

```bash
python app.py
```

Navigate to [127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
